# Algorithm to solve system of inequalities
This is a algorithm solves system of inequalities to find out solutions of the system of inequalities.

## The theoretical basis of the algorithm
The algorithm follows two basic rules as follows:

1. "Additional side" rule
The first is the "additional side" property of two inequalities, the new inequality is always accurate and does not change direction.

2. Multiply the inequality by a constant
Property of multiplying a positive number by an inequality, the inequality remains true and does not change.
